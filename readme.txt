== Description ==

i first like to thanks Wayne Baker, who, somehow, motivated me to reload this plugin with much more improvment.

Now you can check directly in the category admin panel the role you don't want the category to be accessed,
and the implementation of the new advanced categories meta box is much more 'Wordpress compliant'.

thanks to Olly Benson to pointed out and make correction on the last bugs.
